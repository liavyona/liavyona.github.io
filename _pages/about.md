I am a Software Engineer specializing in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and team leadership. Currently, I serve as a Founding Engineer at [Raven](https://raven.io/), where I work on developing an ADR solution that helps security teams discover their entire code vulnerability footprint, identify executed parts, and prevent exploitation in real-time using a policy engine across Multi-Cloud and Kubernetes clusters.

## Experience

Previously, I was a Founding Engineer and Engineering Team Lead at [Firefly](https://firefly.ai/), where I led a team of up to 12 developers and drove the development of a cloud Asset Management solution. I was responsible for shaping system design, event-driven architecture, and scalable infrastructure while managing daily product communication and customer relations.

Before Firefly, I worked at [CyberArk](https://cyberark.com/) on the OSS application Conjur, managing user and machine identities. I also served in Unit 8200 as an Engineering Team Lead and Software Engineer, where I designed and developed smart VPN applications and automation tools for operational needs.

- Speaker at KubeCon and CloudNativeCon Europe 2023
- Published articles in InfoQ, DevZone, and Medium on topics including:
  - Kubernetes migration strategies
  - Policy as Code implementation
