  month={apr},
  url={https://liavyona09.medium.com/mcp-servers-and-how-to-build-them-with-go-11f9aafd8131},
  abstract={As AI applications grow more complex, the need for context-aware interactions becomes critical. This post introduces Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers — a middleware layer that enriches model requests with user, session, and tenant context. We explore the motivations behind MCP, its core responsibilities, and why Go is a great fit for building one. The post includes a minimal example of an MCP server implementation in Go to demonstrate the concept in action.},

  url={https://www.infoq.com/articles/lambda-migration-k8s-jobs/},
  abstract={As a SaaS operation built to handle hundreds of concurrent executions and multiple interfaces like S3, API Gateway requests, lambda functions, SQS & SNS messages, we got started with an AWS lambda functions based architecture, as it was fast, scalable, and suitable for multiple concurrent runners, as the backbone for the main flow of our system. Over time as the lambda functions jobs became more complex, and each operation took more time to complete, to prevent timeouts, which can lead to inconsistencies in data flow, we decided to explore alternative technologies that could withstand the growing load.},

  abstract={Kubernetes environments are very powerful yet quite limited and messy when it comes to integration with cloud products. Lambda, in opposition, by design integrates well with such products. In my latest blog, I want to share with you a simple yet powerful, effective and secure way we can integrate Lambda with existing Kubernetes environment without any codes changes at all.},
