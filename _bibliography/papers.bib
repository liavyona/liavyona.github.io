  title={The Great Lambda Migration to Kubernetes Jobs—A Journey in Three Parts},
  author={Yona, Liav},
  journal={InfoQ},
  year={2023},
  month={03},
  url={https://www.infoq.com/articles/lambda-migration-k8s-jobs/},
  abstract={As a SaaS operation built to handle hundreds of concurrent executions and multiple interfaces like S3, API Gateway requests, lambda functions, SQS & SNS messages, we got started with an AWS lambda functions based architecture, as it was fast, scalable, and suitable for multiple concurrent runners, as the backbone for the main flow of our system. Over time as the lambda functions jobs became more complex, and each operation took more time to complete, to prevent timeouts, which can lead to inconsistencies in data flow, we decided to explore alternative technologies that could withstand the growing load.}

  abstract={Kubernetes environments are very powerful yet quite limited and messy when it comes to integration with cloud products. Lambda, in opposition, by design integrates well with such products. In my latest blog, I want to share with you a simple yet powerful, effective and secure way we can integrate Lambda with existing Kubernetes environment without any codes changes at all.}
